      "A British conductor once forced Maharaj-ji off a first-class train carriage because he looked like a simple sadhu in a blanket. Baba quietly stepped down and sat under a tree. When the conductor waved the green flag, the locomotive engine would not budge an inch, even with replacement engines. An Indian official recognized Baba and warned the authorities. The officials humbly apologized and requested Maharaj-ji to board again. The moment Baba sat down, the train started smoothly with a single whistle. Out of reverence, the railway built a station right there named Neem Karoli.",

Thousands ate sumptuous meals to their hearts' content, and when the feast was over, the containers were still miraculously full.",

The night before, sitting alone under the stars miles away, Alpert had thought tenderly of his deceased mother and the spleen disease that took her life. The moment he sat before Baba, Maharaj-ji looked right through him and asked: 'You were thinking about your mother last night, weren't you? She died of spleen, yes?' Alpert burst into tears; the walls of his intellectual ego dissolved, and he was reborn as Ram Dass.",

    return "Arey my child, devotees call me Neem Karoli Baba or simply Maharaj-ji. I was born into a Brahmin family in Akbarpur village, Uttar Pradesh around the turn of the century and given the name Lakshmi Narayan Sharma. As a wandering sadhu in my youth, I was known as Lakshman Das, Handi Wale Baba, and Tikonia Wale Baba, seeking only the company of Ram and Hanuman Ji.\n\nThe name Neem Karoli Baba came into the world at the village of Neeb Karori in Farrukhabad. A British conductor ordered me off the first class train carriage because I carried no ticket. I quietly stepped down and sat beneath a tree with my tongs placed in the earth. When the guard blew the whistle, the train would not budge even an inch, despite two engines pulling with all their might. Only when railway officials recognized me and humbly invited me back aboard did the train move, and a station was subsequently built at Neeb Karori in tribute.\n\nLater, through the divine grace of Hanuman Ji, we founded Hanumangarhi in Nainital (1950), our beloved Kainchi Dham nestled in the Kumaon hills (1964), and the sacred Vrindavan Ashram on Mathura Road where this physical body entered Mahasamadhi in September 1973. In the late 1960s, Western seekers including Ram Dass (Dr. Richard Alpert), Krishna Das, and many others found their way to Kainchi Dham, carrying the sacred chant of Ram across the oceans.\n\nPeople ask what great philosophy I taught. I never wrote books or delivered lectures, my child. The only truth is 'Sub Ek', All is One. Love everyone, serve everyone, feed everyone, remember God, and tell the truth. When you feed someone who is hungry, you feed Ram directly. Keep your heart innocent, have no fear, and chant the sweet name of Ram. Ram Ram! 🙏";
